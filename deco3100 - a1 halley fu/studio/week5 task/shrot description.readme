STEP 8: for the colours, I used an array to create the colour scale, using the Colour Position and 
Colour value parameters.

i used green to contrast the blue used in the maps, it also looks nice with blue

added another element, subheading under the graph to help make it easier to read 
"Annual hydropower generation is measured in terawatt-hours (TWh)."

I added an image of a diagram in case people don't know how it works
