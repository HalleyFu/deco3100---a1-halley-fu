            <h1 class>Control how you feel with Aerate.</h1>
            <p>It's a common experience for office employees to finish work and feel tired -
                with only enough energy to crash, not to thrive. We easily blame this on personal choices like poor sleep or diet
                - factors we can control. But what if the real cause is something we canâ€™t see. My visualisation uses the SAMBA sensor
                data to reveal how rising CO2, increasing temperatures, and elevated noise levels - joined together leave workers feeling
                fatigued before they even leave the office.</p>

            <p>High Co2 levels are a sign of poorly regulated air quality. This can cause <strong>headaches, fatigue, and even stress.</strong> 
                Workers can become more irritable which can lead to poor <strong>decision-making and increased stress levels</strong>. Using SAMBA data
            that tracks your workplace <strong>Aerate</strong> can help you visualise the Co2 levels in your office with our Live Dashboard. In doing <source>
        you can see how the co2 levels are changing and you can know when to step out of the office for fresh air.</p>

            <p>High sound levels contribute to <strong>overstimulation</strong> and stress leaving you tired by the end of the day. SAMBDA sensors track noise activity in your office and
                <strong>Aerate</strong> uses this data to help you visualise the sound levels in your office with our Live Dashboard. In doing so, you can see how the sound levels are changing and
                you can know when to put on headphones and earplugs to help you relax.</p>
