            <p>It's a common experience for office employees to finish work and feel tired -
                with only enough energy to crash, not to thrive. We easily blame this on personal choices like poor sleep or diet
                - factors we can control. But what if the real cause is something we canâ€™t see. My visualisation uses 
                the SAMBA (Sentient Ambient Monitoring of Buildings in Australia) sensor
                data to reveal how rising CO2, increasing temperatures, and elevated noise levels - joined together leave workers feeling
                fatigued before they even leave the office.</p>

            <p>Aerate partners with the Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) Lab using their low cost sensors distributed in your offices. We're able to 
                provide real-time data that powers our dashboard and helps you understand your indoor environment.</p>

            <h2 class>CO2 The Silent Killer</h2>
            <p>High CO2 levels are a sign of poorly regulated air quality. This can cause <strong>headaches, fatigue, 
                and even stress</strong> (AirGradient, 2025; Clairify, 2023; CO2Meter, n.d.). Workers can become more irritable, 
                which can lead to poor decision-making and increased stress levels (Disruptive Technologies, 2022; uHoo, 2025). 
                High CO2 concentrations have also been linked to reduced cognitive performance, <strong>including impaired concentration and 
                decision-making</strong> (Castus, 2025; Tektelic, 2024). Using SAMBA data that tracks your workplace, Aerate can help 
                you visualise the CO2 levels in your office with our Live Dashboard. In doing so, you can see how the CO2 levels 
                are changing and you can know when to step out of the office for fresh air.

            <h2 class>The Office Humdrum</h2>
            <p>High sound levels contribute to overstimulation and stress, leaving you tired by the end of the day. 
                Research indicates that prolonged exposure to a noisy work environment can lead to heightened stress 
                levels, reduced concentration, emotional fatigue, and increased irritability (Health Assured, 2025; 
                TalktoAngel, 2025). The brain constantly attempts to filter out irrelevant auditory stimuli, an effort 
                that can lead to <strong>cognitive overload</strong> and fatigue (TalktoAngel, 2025). 
                SAMBDA sensors track noise activity in your office and Aerate uses this data to visualise 
                the sound levels. In doing so, you can see how the sound levels 
                are changing and you can know when to put on headphones and earplugs to help you relax.

            <h2 class>Air Temperature: The first suspect</h2>
            <p>High air temperatures can lead to discomfort and fatigue, making it hard to focus. 
                Studies have shown that when office temperatures exceed the optimal range, cognitive 
                functions begin to decline, <strong>affecting focus, concentration, and decision-making</strong> 
                (DBH Group, 2025; Symphony, 2025). Prolonged exposure to high temperatures also 
                contributes to increased stress and irritability (Symphony, 2025). 
                The physical discomfort caused by excessive heat can cause discomfort and lead to decreased productivity (Lamina Heat, 2024). 
                SAMBA sensors track the temperature in your office and Aerate graphs this data to help 
                you understand the temperature levels in your office with our Live Dashboard. In doing so, 
                you can see how the temperature is changing and you can know when to adjust the thermostat 
                or open a window for fresh air.
